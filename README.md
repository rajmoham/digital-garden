# Digital Garden

Quartz is a popular static website generator which converts markdown files into aesthetic pages to view as a website. 

This digital garden is a forked version of Quartz which strips down a lot of the bloated features (which I do not and will never) intend to use.
It also removes any need to have the repository alongside my notes, and automates the entire sync process to my liking.

And below is the obligatory quote to inspire learning:
